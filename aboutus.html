        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the College Canteen! We are proud to be a cornerstone of campus life.</p>
        <h2><center>OUR HISTORY</center></h2>
        <p>The College Canteen has been serving the college community since its establishment in 1997. Originally a modest operation housed in a small cafeteria, it has grown over the years to become a bustling hub of activity and a beloved institution on campus.</p>
        <p>Throughout its history, the canteen has undergone numerous renovations and expansions to accommodate the growing needs of our students, faculty, and staff. What began as a simple food service has evolved into a vibrant social space where friendships are forged, ideas are exchanged, and memories are made.</p>
        <p>Despite the changes over the years, our commitment to providing delicious and nutritious meals remains unwavering. We continue to strive for excellence in everything we do, from the quality of our ingredients to the warmth of our service.</p>
        <p>As we look to the future, we are excited to continue serving the college community and being a place where students can gather, refuel, and recharge as they pursue their academic goals.</p>
